Purpose of this branch
======================
This branch is to include the add mode into the utility.


Primary change is in the doAdd method in plibCommands.py.  To trap error from rgrCsvData/findAdex.py, that module was altered to generate an exception for detected errors.

Progress notes on this branch

=============================


Add works with the test csv file.
*) check that a new entry works. (yes)
*) then try errors 
   Not enough params (yes)
   lower case cat (yes)
   invalid cat (yes)
   using "key words" for >1 key word (yes)
   Avoid duplicate entries (yes)
   Any See Also items must exist as well (yes)

*) Check that Xn00 adds the next new topic value. Yes
*) If there is an error the DB is still backed up and saved. (resolved)
*) Having no See also should be simpler in the code 
   - csvDataBase.addEntry() should work with a zero length *args (fixed)

Merge Check List
================
Prior to merge and remove

1) Reset the logging levels in all the modules
   Remove any superfuouis print statements
2) Update the version info in plib-topic.py
3) Reset paths to csv files in plibCommands.py

Other Issues
============
Loading of CSV data
1) cannot handle a blank line (?? ok in findAdex.py)
2) Saving seems to not be in the alph numberic order I expected.
   An entry for A901 comes between _800 and _900?
   Maybe correct afer all!
